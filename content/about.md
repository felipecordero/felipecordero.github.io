title: "About"

intro: >
  Hi! I'm Felipe Cordero, a structural engineer and software developer with over 14 years of experience in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) world. I started out designing buildings and infrastructure in Chile, but over the years I've found myself drawn to solving bigger, systemic problems—things like automation, optimization, and how tech can transform the way we build.

study: >
  Right now, I'm living in Montréal and diving deep into AI and Machine Learning at Collège LaSalle. It's been an exciting shift—combining my background in engineering with tools like Python, PyTorch, and predictive modeling to build smarter systems.

passion_text: >
  I'm especially interested in applying AI to real-world engineering challenges, and that's what I've been doing at ObraLink. There, I lead the development of autonomous tools for real-time structural analysis and machine learning models that estimate concrete demand with surprising accuracy.

mix: >
  What sets me apart? I think it's the mix. I understand buildings, I speak code fluently, and I know how to lead teams that build things—from concrete foundations to clean, scalable software. I love bringing structure to complexity and finding elegant ways to make systems work better.

personal: >
  When I'm not working, I'm probably playing tennis, cooking, playing drums, swimming, or just out exploring with my camera. I also enjoy volunteering, like welcoming new students to LaSalle
  College.
