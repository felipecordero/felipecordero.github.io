title: "About"

intro: >
  Hi! I'm Felipe Cordero, a **structural engineer** and **software developer** with over **14 years of experience** in the AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) world. I started out designing buildings and infrastructure in Chile, but over the years I've found myself drawn to solving bigger, systemic problems—things like **automation**, **optimization**, and how tech can transform the way we build.

study: >
  Right now, I'm living in Montréal and diving deep into **AI and Machine Learning** at Collège LaSalle. It's been an exciting shift—combining my background in engineering with tools like **Python**, **PyTorch**, and **predictive modeling** to build smarter systems.

passion_title: "What I'm passionate about"
passion_text: >
  I'm passionate about applying AI to real-world engineering problems. At <a href="https://fireraven.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Fireraven</strong></a>, I’m developing secure **LLM-based agents**, optimizing performance, and managing **PostgreSQL** databases for compliant, real-time deployment.

  Previously at <a href="https://obralink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>ObraLink</strong></a>, I led the development of **autonomous structural analysis tools** and **machine learning models** for accurate concrete demand estimation.


mix: >
  What sets me apart? I think it's the mix. I understand **buildings**, I speak **code** fluently, and I know how to **lead teams** that build things—from concrete foundations to clean, scalable software. I love bringing **structure to complexity** and finding elegant ways to make systems work better.

personal: >
  When I'm not working, I'm probably playing **tennis**, **cooking**, playing **drums**, **swimming**, or just out exploring with my **camera**. I also enjoy **volunteering**, like welcoming new students to LaSalle College.
