Welcome to my blog! I'm excited to share my journey of creating this website and the experiences that led me here. As a structural engineer with a passion for software development, I wanted a platform that could effectively showcase both my technical expertise and professional experience.

## Why This Website?

After exploring various options, I chose to build this site using Hugo, a powerful static site generator, and created my own theme called CareerCanvas. This decision was driven by several factors:

- **Performance**: Hugo's static site generation ensures lightning-fast loading times
- **Flexibility**: The ability to create custom layouts and components
- **Developer Experience**: Writing content in Markdown makes it easy to focus on what matters
- **Modern Design**: A clean, responsive interface that works beautifully on all devices

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be sharing insights about:

- **Structural Engineering**: My experiences and projects in the field
- **Software Development**: Tips and tricks for engineers learning to code
- **AI in Construction**: The latest developments and applications
- **BIM Automation**: Streamlining construction processes
- **Construction Technology**: Reviews and tutorials of useful tools

## The Tech Stack

This website is built with:

- **Hugo**: For static site generation
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, utility-first styling
- **CareerCanvas**: My custom theme designed for technical professionals
- **GitHub**: For version control and deployment

## Join Me on This Journey

I'll be sharing not just technical content, but also my experiences in:

- Creating and maintaining this website
- Developing the CareerCanvas theme
- Learning and implementing new web technologies
- Balancing engineering and software development

Stay tuned for more content coming soon! I'm particularly excited to share my experience with creating the CareerCanvas theme and how it can help other technical professionals showcase their work effectively.
