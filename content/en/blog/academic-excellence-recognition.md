Receiving recognition for academic excellence from Air Canada during my graduation from the Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning program at Collège LaSalle, Montréal has been an unforgettable and deeply emotional moment. This achievement represents not just academic success, but a testament to faith, family support, and perseverance.

## The Journey

The path to this recognition has been anything but easy. After years in the professional world, returning to formal education presented its own set of challenges. However, the decision to leave Chile nearly two years ago—leaving behind our families, friends, and everything familiar to start a new chapter in Canada—added another layer of complexity to this journey.

## The Support System

This recognition is not mine alone. It belongs to:

- My wife and children, who have stood by me every step of the way
- My parents and siblings in Chile, whose support transcended distance
- The faculty at Collège LaSalle, Montréal
- My classmates, whose dedication and hard work inspired me daily
- Special thanks to Emile Dufour, Lyne Tremblay, and Elisa Schaeffer

## The Role of Faith

Throughout this journey, there were moments when the challenges seemed insurmountable. It was in these moments that I experienced the sustaining power of God's love most clearly. The decision to move to Canada was not just a career move—it was a step of faith, and God has been faithful every step of the way.

As I move forward into my internship at Fireraven, I do so with:

- Renewed strength and joy
- A heart full of gratitude
- The support of an outstanding team

- The knowledge that the best is yet to come
