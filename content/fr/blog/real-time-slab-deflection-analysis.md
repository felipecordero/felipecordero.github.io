ðŸ”§ Real-time information about slab deflections during construction? Yes, it's possibleâ€”and I developed it! At <a href="https://obralink.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ObraLink</a>, I led the design and implementation of a new functionality that automatically analyzes slab deflections in real-time using BIM data and sensors. No manual modeling. No delays. Just key structural information, precisely when needed.
